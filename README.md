# Mix & Mask
A submission for the 2026 Global Game Jam, hosted at UMBC.

Play as a mysterious mask in a haunted manor with the ability to possess all manner of monsters! When possessed, you get to attack the other monsters, but they attack you back. Fling yourself from monster to monster and try to survive as many waves as possible!

Use the left mouse button to fling yourself onto nearby enemies!

You can use their abilities by using the left and right clicks on your mouse, and use space to pop yourself off the enemy you're controlling if its health gets low!

Play for as long as you can! The game spawns enemies in waves infinitely! We'd love to see your Game Over screenshots to see how many enemies you can defeat before being defeated!

Made in Unity 6.3 LTS with Wwise 2025.1.4.
